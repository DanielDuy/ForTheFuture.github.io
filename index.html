                    <strong>Taken from Science.org: "Climate change is a change in the pattern of weather, and related changes in oceans, land surfaces and ice sheets, occurring over time scales of decades or longer". According to The United Nations website: "Climate change is affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and weather events are becoming more extreme". Even animal species are dying out, because of the changes on our planet. If we don't, the sea levels will raise, entire animal species will die out, the climate will get warmer and more extreme, and it will be irreversible.</strong>

                    Gas and diesel cars, planes, boats, factories etc. release loads of CO_2 which is highly dangerous for our climate. Even though we have to stop using these types of transportations and creations, we are already way too dependent to "just" stop. Therefore people must come together and find alternatives to change our ways of living and using.

                <p>
                    We at OXYCAR are a newly formed company. We want to save our planet. Our goal is to siqnifiqolty reduce the “Greenhouse” gases that cars let out in the air. According to NASA “Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 47% since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.” ( climate.nasa.gov) the CO2 in the air is increasing at an alarming rate, but we at OXYCAR want to stop this increase. We envision us a future where we gradually change from fuel to electricity and we want to help in making that leap better for the environment.
